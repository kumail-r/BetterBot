# BetterBot
A general purpose Discord bot written in Java using Discord4J.
## Purpose
Created in order to learn how to make a Discord bot using Discord4J. The intention is to implement common bot functionalities to reduce dependency on other people's code in my servers.
## Current Features
* Display commands and syntax
* Change prefix
* Ping
* Reddit integration to post memes
* Polling (using reactions)
* Random number generator
* Music player (very, very barebones ATM. I haven't even put it in the help menu because of how incomplete it is.)
## Planned Features
* Text based game
* Timer/reminder system
* Track reactions to apply user roles
* MyAnimeList/AniList integration
